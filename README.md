# Template for thesis
This is a template for a bachelor or master thesis. It is made for the [university of applied science munich](https://www.hm.edu/), but can be used for any other university as well. Just change the logo and the name. Be sure to check if the format complies with the standards of your university.

## IDE
I used [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to write my theses with the plugin [LaTeX Workshop](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop) from [James-Yu](https://github.com/James-Yu).
For German spell checking I recommend [LTex - Language Tool](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=valentjn.vscode-ltex) from [Julian Valentin](https://github.com/valentjn).
